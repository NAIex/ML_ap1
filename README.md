This small project was done for the Machine Learning course held in the 5th semester from the Faculty of Computer Science from Ia»ôi. This structure is quite small:
- id3.py        : This file holds all the logic for the ID3 algorithm
- data.py       : This file holds all the logic for reading excel files and extracting the data regarding the production and consumption of energy
- attempt_1.py  : This file contains the attempt at predicting the production attributes.
  - attempt_1_RMSE.py: This file is the same as its parent, just that is also has RMSE calculation at the end.
- attempt_2.py  : This file contains the attempt at predicting the production attributes.
